Task #1:
In full_message.dart (reach it by clicking on the message title on one of the post cards on the home screen). On this page, we have two buttons that can be clicked on (plus & minus) -> (lines 464-596). The issue is that on this page, the text/colors do not render immediately when clicked. In order to see the change, you need to go back to the home screen and then click back on the title to return to the full message screen. Then you can see the changes to the UI made. Instead, I want the text/colors changing immeditaly just like when you click on the two buttons on the Home Screen. Keep in mind that the two buttons are also associated with the post card buttons on the Home screen. So if changes are made in one page, they should also render on the other page. Also feel free to get rid of the "LikeAnimation" widget as I no longer need it.
The changes should also reflect in the backend (lines 183-221 in AFirestoreMethods.dart).

Task #2
In full_message.dart, when you click on the filter_list icon, it opens up a container with several buttons. If you have a long message and/or several comments displayed on the UI, whenever the user clicks on one of the buttons or closes the filter container, the screen will scroll upwards automatically. I want to avoid this. I do not want the page to scroll whatsoever whenever any of those buttons are clicked. I believe the scrolling occurs because everytime we click on a button, it sets the state and setting the state makes the comments refresh and this makes the page temporarily lose some of its previous height and therefore, automatically scrolls back to the top of the page.

Task #3
In comment_card.dart, I have a "Show More" Button that cuts off anything with 2 or more lines of text. The problem is that the button appears even if we have less than 2 lines of text. Instead, I only want to see the "Show More" button whenerver there's a comment with 2 or more lines of text.

Task #4
In comment_card.dart (lines 80-89), we have two icons which currently represent the same icons as the ones when you click the plus/minus button higher in the  full message page or on the home screen page. If the user voted plus/green, I would want only the plus/green icon to be displayed. If the user voted minus/red, I would want only the minus/red icon to be displayed. If the user didn't vote at all, no icons should be displayed. This should also render and update if the user chnages their vote.

Task #5
In comment_card.dart (lines 90-133), we have a "more.vertical" icon. Clicking on this icon gives the user the option to delete the commentbut clicking on delete doesn't delete the comment. This is likely a mistake made in AFirestoreMethods.dart (lines 280-292).You can refer to the method used when deleting a post (lines 271-278). Deleting a posts works successfully but deleting a comment doesn't. The problem to solve here is to delete the comment whenever the user cliks on "delete" in comment_card.dart.

Task #6
In comment_card.dart (lines 211-361), we have a "reply" button. When clicked on, it should open a text field under the corresponding comment. It shouldnt open a text field under all comments but only the one where the button was clicked. Feel free to use the commented out code (lines 255-361) as a guide. When the user sends a message in that new text field, it should send it inside a new sub-collection within the comment collection. So currently in firebase we have a posts collection -> within that posts collection we have a sub-collection named "comments" and now within that sub-collection, I want a new collection named "replies". I believe the error here is once again in AFirestoreMethods.dart file (lines 294-324). The replies don't need to be displayed on the screen, as long as we can see a new collection created within firebase, that should be enough for this task.

If you have any questions or would like me to clarify any of the tasks, don't hesitate to ask!
