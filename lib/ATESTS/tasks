Task#1
In full_message_poll.dart (lines 95-150), I would like to see the names of the poll options be displayed there instead of the static "option 1", "option 2", etc. This would work similarly to filtering comments by vote in full_message.dart. Clicking on a specific poll option in the filter section would only show the comments sent by users who voted for that specific poll option. 

Task #2
If you create a new poll, go to the home screen and vote, you'll notice that you can give a 2nd vote if you head to the comments page. I'd like this to be fixed to make sure that each user can only vote once.

Task #3
In comment_card.dart (lines 705-740), clicking ont hat specific "send" button doesn't seem to be working properly, clicking the send button doesn't perform any action. 

Task #4
If you go to settings and click on "Blocked List", you'll notice an empty page. On this page we should instead have a list of the user's blocked accounts. That list should cpontain objects such as: the profile image of the blocked user + their username and also include a "remove" button that lets the user remove any account from that list. The accounts in that list will no longer show up in the user's messages or polls feed. In order to add a user to that list, you simply have to click on the 3 small dots icon on the right side of a message card and then click "Block User", once that button is clicked, a snackbar will appear saying "user blocked" as soon as that account is successfully blocked.

Task #5
If you go to settings and click on "Delete Account", it'll delete that specific user from the "users" collection in the firestore databse, but on top of this I would also like to see the account get removed from the "authentication" -> "users" section of firebase as well. 

Task #6
I'd like a small change made to the username rules. Currently, if you try to make an account with named "abc" and then make a second account but this time name it "ABC", it'll let you create those two accounts. Instead, if there's already a username named "abc", any username with the exact same combination of letters/numbers (regardless of capital or lower case letters), shouldn't be allowed to be created.

Task #7
In message_card.dart (line 542), you'll notice that we have two if statements. I'd like to add an additional one, If _post.selected == 2, it should show the uploaded video from phone get displayed on the message card. Similar to how _post.selected == 3 videos are displayed.

Task #8
In profile_screen_edit.dart, I want the user to be able to change their profile picture from that screen.

Task #9
In profile_screen_edit.dart, the user has the option to display the flag image on their profile page or not. When a user's profileFlag value is set to "true" in the backend, it should display the flag image to other users that visit their profile. And when profileFlag value is false, it should instead not show the flag image at all. Additionally, their bio message should show up as well. Currently, the bio message shown on the profile pages is always the bio message from the currently logged in user. Instead it should show the bio message from the specific user/profile account that you're visiting.

Task #10
In profile_screen.dart (line 787), Instead of showing static text on the last tab, I'd instead like this tab to show all messages + polls that the user previously voted (messages and polls should be mixed together into one stream/list). The most recently voted messages/polls should always appear at the top/first in the list.

Task #11
In profile_screen.dart (line 725), if you create multiple messages + polls, then scroll down the list on one tab and then switch to another tab, you'll notice that the list won't start from the beginning but instead it'll keep the scroll location from the previous tab. Instead, whenever the user switches tabs, it should always start the list from the #1 message/poll on the index.

Task #12
On the home_screen.dart file (lines 105-180), we have two functions that refresh the order of polls/messages whenever its called. This allows streams/lists to not change order in real time and only change when that function is called instead. If possible, I'd like that same logic to be applied to the comments & profile page.

1. (for comments) -> when sort/or filter button is clicked or when the user initially opens up this page, the function should be called.

2. (for profile) -> when a tab on the tabBar is clicked or when the user initially opens this page, the function should be called.
