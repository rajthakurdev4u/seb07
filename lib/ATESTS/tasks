Task #1 
In add_screen.dart (line 1480) if you click on "polls" (clicking on one of the radio buttons in the app bar), you'll notice that the max character length for each option is 50. I'd like to move the 0/50 character counter and put it inside the text field instead. The position of the character counter doesn't have to be specific, as long as I can move it myself with other widgets such as padding, stack and others this should be fine!

Task #2
In add_screen.dart (lines 520-600) -> (in the poll screen again).. You'll notice that if you click on the "send poll" button but there's nothing written down in any input fields, two errors will pop up explaining to the user that the text fields cannot remain blank. There are two specific problems to fix here. 1) If the first two poll option text fields have something written down but the poll question is still empty and then you click the "send poll" button, you'll notice that the 2nd error still pops up (which shouldn't be the case because the first two poll options text fields are not empty) - in other words, only the first error should pop up. 2) Sometimes when all text fields have somethign written down in them and you click on "send poll", it'll show "RangeError" in the snackbar and not post the message. This is is likely another error caused by the if statemnts in lines 520-600 but I'm not entirely certain!

Task #3
In add_screen.dart -> (this time in the "message" screen section).. You'll notice there are 4 icon buttons dispalyed in a row, the 4th icon button doesn't have any functions yet. When clicking on this icon, it should have the exact same function as the 2nd icon button where clicking it opens up a dialog box with an option for "camera" or "gallery". The only difference here is that the 2nd icon button is specifically to open/upload images from your phone (using the ImagePicker dependency). This time, the 4th icon button should open/upload videos from your phone. And when opening the camera, it should open the camera to let the user record a video. I believe this YouTube video could assist you in completing this task: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAgLOAGga2o . The selected video from the phone should be displayed in the same area where the image is displayed when the user selects an image. As long as the video is displayed without any errors and the functions work correctly, this should be fine. No need to worry about all the other small details!

Task #4
In poll_card.dart, you'll notice that we're only displaying the different poll options inside of simple text widgets. Instead I would want this poll card to become a fully functional poll system where users can click on each displayed poll option to give their vote. Once the user votes, the results should show up in %. And also when a user votes, they cannot re-vote (they can only vote once). There should also be a time limit for the poll. Once the time limit is reached, no user should have the ability to vote and final results would be displayed to everyone (even to users who haven't yet voted). Feel free to use dependencies such as https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_polls or https://pub.dev/packages/polls to finish this task. 

Task #5
In ASignup.dart, when a user signs up, uploading a profile picture is a requirement. I want to make this optional. If no file is uploaded, the circle avatar picture shoud instead display the "anonymous user" picture that you see when no file is yet selected.

Task #6
In ASignup.dart, when a user signs up, they can choose any character + whatever length as their username. I want this to be changed.
1) If the username is already taken by another registered user, it shouldn't allow them to signup. It should also display a message as a snackbar to inform them that the username is already taken.
2) The username should only be between 3-16 characters long.
3) The username should only allow letters and numbers (no spaces, dashes, underscores, special characters, etc.)

Task #7
In ALogin.dart, the first text field currently only allows the user to login with their email. Instead, I want the firts text field to allow either the username or the email to be used to login into their account.

Task #8
In ALogin.dart, the user has an option to change their password if they forgot it. I've noticed that if you click on "Authentication" -> "Templates" in the firebase console, there's an option for "Email address change". I would like to implement this option into the project as well. I want to give the users the option to change their email address if they feel like it.
Additionally, I would also want an option for the user to change their username. For additional security, the user should re-authenticate before changing their email or username.
All fo this can be done in the "profile screen" section of the app.

Task #9
On the home screen, if you click on the settings icon and then click on "Report User", it will navigate you to a new page with two containers/buttons. My goal is to send the message inside the pressed button and receive it by email. If you click on "one" it should send me "one" as the email message. If you click on "two" it should send me "two" as the email message. It should send the email right when the buttons are clicked and you shouldn't have to log into any email account to accomplish this. I'm not sure if this is possible but not exposing/storing the password within the code would also be very beneficial for security purposes. I'm also open to any other notification system where I could receive information and be notified in real time based on actions taken within the app. But receving information via email would probbably be the best case scenario. let me know if you have any suggestions here!
